       "'####An easy sundress and a chic pair of sandals will forever be a look that just screams “summer”. No matter your age nor your location, pairing dresses with sandals is simply a no-brainer. You know I love a good styling session – my posts on how to style wide-leg pants and how to style a midi skirt are evidence of this. So of course I couldn’t resist putting together some favorite dress and sandal combinations for summer. Today I’m highlighting everything from trendy platform sandals with mod dresses to minimalist chic sandals with slip dresses. There’s a little bit of everything because we all know sticking to just one style wouldn’t be any fun!####While you know I love to mix and match separates, dresses are a must-have for me, especially when the temps soar. Why? Simply put, dresses are so easy! You can quickly throw on a great statement earring or some simple layered necklaces and a great flat, and just like that, your outfit is complete. This combination also makes packing a breeze. I am ramping up my travel this summer and carrying along a suitcase full of dresses with sandals makes getting ready to jet even easier.####Okay, now for the fun part. I’m always inspired by the fashion at the start of each season. The excitement of wearing pieces that have been hiding in my closet, just waiting for the weather to change. And the thrill of seeing new collections launch from my favorite designers, both new and old. It all just makes me a little giddy, you know? This year is no exception and I’ve been swooning over so many pairings of dresses with sandals that have caught my eye!####First up, the sandal that I have been wearing the most – slide sandals. I decided to invest in this great pair of cream slide sandals this season and I have no regrets! Admittedly, I loved them so much that I went back for them in pink! I have been wearing my cream slides with this affordable midi dress (under $50!) and this beautiful embroidered mini dress. As for the pink slides, I’ve been pairing them with this fabulous striped cover-up, as seen here.####If you are looking for a more budget-friendly option, I highly suggest this classic pair of slide sandals. These cuties come in six colors (including an on-trend raffia option). Plus, they would look great with just about any summer outfit you can think of. If you want something a bit more feminine, I adore these raffia bow sandals (also available in leather). They would look stunning worn with this bold mini dress or this fun tiered midi dress! Last, but not least, if you are looking for a true statement slide, these wavy sandals are my current favorite – and they’re on sale. I love how they mimic a scallop, making them look divine paired with any scallop-detailed dress, like this cream midi dress, which is also on sale!####Next up, let’s talk about minimalism for summer. While I consider myself a maximalist (is anyone surprised?), I do try to tone it down every once in a while! And this summer I happen to be loving minimalist sandals. I think this black pearl sandal was the style that got me hooked on this trend. Right now, my current favorites are this suede pair, these black kitten-heels, these simple tan sandals and these everyday black sandals.####There are endless combinations of dresses with sandals that can be created with these minimalist styles. Personally, I love pairing them with dresses that are streamlined, such as a simple slip dress. Some of my current favorites are this black and white polka dot dress, this lace and satin slipdress (under $100) and this asymmetrical floral dress, which is an investment, but so oh-so-stunning!####One of my recent favorite trends is the return of the platform! I love the additional height these sandals provide and how it elongates every look. Plus, these sandals look amazing paired with mod dress silhouettes, which also happen to be trending right now. This pairing is such a fun combination of dresses with sandals!####This pair of neutral platform sandals have been on repeat for me. I love the woven raffia-like texture, plus the color matches everything! Chances are you’ve seen me wear them this summer with a variety of outfits including this green pants outfit, this mod mini dress, this purple caftan, and this elegant pink dress. I can’t emphasize enough how much I love them!####Another current favorite pair of sandals are these orange platforms, which I recently styled with this fun and bold dress while in Paris. I’ve also been eyeing these white platforms – I love the contrasting woven jute heel against the leather on top. And these black braided platform sandals that I bought last month are currently on sale for under $125! I wore them with this tan and black shirt dress from my latest collection with Tuckernuck. ####Although this post is all about pairing dresses with sandals, I would be remiss not to mention the versatility of these pieces. It’s no secret that not only do these items pair well together, but mixing and matching them with other wardrobe staples allows you to get the most bang for your buck. Here are a few ways I love to wear dresses and sandals separately – you can click on each for outfit inspiration!'"
